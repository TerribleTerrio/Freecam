# Lethal Company Extended Freecam

This mod is based on the mod by DaXcess which enables the built-in Freecam disabled by default in Lethal Company. This mod also adds a few features, such as zooming in and out (E and Q), moving up and down (Jump and Crouch), and speeding up or slowing down each of these with Shift and Alt.

The inputs are tied to the base game's bindings except for Alt. I may add custom binds later, but for now this is a very quick modification of the forked mod.
