# Lethal Company Extended Freecam

This mod is based on the mod by DaXcess which enables the built-in Freecam disabled by default in Lethal Company. This mod also adds a few features to the cinematic camera, such as zooming in and out, moving up and down, and speeding up or slowing down.

The inputs are tied to the base game's bindings except for where it is not specified:
- Zoom in: E (Based on in-game "Item Tertiary Use" bind)
- Zoom out: Q (Based on in-game "Item Secondary Use" bind)
- Move up: Space (Based on in-game "Jump" bind)
- Move down: Left Ctrl (Based on in-game "Crouch" bind)
- Speed up: Left Shift (Based on in-game "Sprint" bind)
- Slow down: Left Alt
- Toggle camera on and off: Z
- Toggle hud on and off while in camera: X
- Toggle between player and camera control: C
- Toggle camera to follow player: V
- Bring camera to player's position: B

I might add config for the custom binds later, but for now this is just a very quick modification of the original.
